# euchre
COMP4106A Project

## Setup Requirements
- Python 3.5 or higher

## Operation Instructions
- Unzip repository
- Run from command line:
  ```
  $ cd euchre
  $ python3 src/main.py
  ```
- Running with no command line arguments begins with 4 computer players
  - To play the game yourself with 3 computer players, must pass "true" as a command line argument
    ```
    $ python3 src/main.py true
    ```
- The main.py script includes a shebang, so if you feel like it...
  ```
  $ chmod ugo+x src/main.py
  $ ./src/main.py
  ```
